A Library website that uses HTML, CSS, and PHP that connects to a mysql database to store, edit, and retrieve database entries. (Group Project)

Used MAMP in order to install a localhost and run our webpage. Download the Library Database folder and copy it into htdocs when running MAMP. You may take out the MySQL Commands.txt since 
this is just to show the commands used to set up the database. Afterwards run MAMP and make sure that the URL says: http://localhost:8888

Afterwards, you should be able to navigate through the webpage and connect the database. 
This is a very simple library database, where we can create a library account, check out books, return books, and delete the library account.
